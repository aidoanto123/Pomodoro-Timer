# ⏳ Pomodoro Timer – Python Tkinter

A **Pomodoro Timer** built using Python's `tkinter` GUI library.  
Implements the Pomodoro productivity technique — alternating between focused work sessions and timed breaks — to help improve focus and productivity.  
Includes a visual interface with a countdown timer, start/reset buttons, and checkmarks to track completed work sessions.
